# Wednesday Lessons
Today we start with an introduction to statistics, and then see our first taste of machine learning

Agenda:

 1. [Probability and Statistics](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/Day%203%20-%20Probability%20and%20Statistics%20-%20Morning.ipynb) interactive lecture via jupyter notebook
	 - Here is a [reference sheet with formulas](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/FormulaSheet.pdf) 
 2. [Statistics distributions](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/Distributions.ipynb) interactive lecture via jupyter notebook
 3. Program your own random card generator (one possible [solution](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/RandomCardGenerator.py) ) 
 4. Introduction to [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/Naive_Bayes_Lesson.pdf) (PDF, lecture)
 5. Example of Naive Bayes in a [criminal investigation](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/CourtCaseBayes.pdf) as a PDF; and [printable PDF](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/CourtCaseBayes_pf.pdf).  This is similar to the [Birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).
 6. [Monty Hall problem](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/MontyHall_NaiveBayes.ipynb) and [solutions](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/MontyHall_NaiveBayes_Answers.ipynb)
 We also have an older version of this notebook, with 2 more problems: [Naive Bayes interactive notebook with four problems (Monty Hall, symbols, Laplace smoothing, unknown features)](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/01_Naive_Bayes.ipynb) and [solution](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/01_Naive_Bayes_Answers.ipynb)
 7. [Intro to machine learning](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/jupyterhub_AWS_deployment/blob/master/notebooks/machineLearning_notebooks/01_Naive_Bayes/Intro_to_Machine_Learning.pdf) (PDF, lecture)
